of fascinating stories to tell. Back in the day, Persians, Ottoman Turks, Byzantine Greeks, 
Russians all came as enemies, but stayed as friends. Since its very beginning, the city has 
attracted people of all walks of life and welcomed people of contrasting cultures, different 
languages and religion; and by doing so, the city has enriched itself and ornamented the 
country with an immense diversity. </p>
<p>Tbilisi is sure to charm you with its grace and hospitality, something you’ll certainly 
experience upon interaction with its people. Stroll around the Old Town for a glimpse of the 
past, get lost in the little streets, wander through its fresh local markets, enjoy the 
picturesque architecture, indulge in the many inviting cafes, or absorb the history in the 
spruced-up museums. The nightlife is also teeming with young people. This is a new modern 
city that is slowly opening itself up to the world.</p>`,
